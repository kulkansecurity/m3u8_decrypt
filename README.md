# m3u8_decrypt.py â€“ PoC for decrypting HLS Streams 

## Features 

`m3u8_decrypt.py` is a PoC script in python that can be used to **automate the download and decryption** of encrypted HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) media content. It reads `.m3u8` playlists, fetches encrypted `video segments` and their corresponding `encryption key` files, and outputs decrypted `.ts` files ready for playback or further processing. 

The script was released along with a Blog post on Watermark bypasses, available at:

## Installation 

This tool depends on the following Python libraries: 
- `requests` 
- `cryptography` 

Install them with: ``` pip install requests cryptography ``` 

Just clone/download the script and run it.

## Usage 

``` python3 m3u8_decrypt.py ``` 

The script will prompt you for: 

1. **.m3u8 file URL** (e.g., `https://example.com/playlist/index.m3u8`) 
2. **Base URL for .key files** (e.g., `https://example.com/playlist/`) 

Once provided, it will: 
- Download the `.m3u8` playlist. 
- Identify all `.ts.enc` segments. 
- Download each encrypted segment and its corresponding `.key` file. 
- Decrypt each segment into a `.ts` file. 
- Save encrypted and decrypted files to: 
- `./encrypted_files/` 
- `./decrypted_files/` 

If authentication is required (e.g., JWT or cookies), you can configure them in the script by editing the `jwt` and `cookies` variables in the `main()` function.
